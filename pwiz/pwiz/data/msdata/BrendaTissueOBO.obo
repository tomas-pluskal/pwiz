The hypothalamus may be divided into five regions or areas (area hypothalamica rostralis, area hypothalamica dorsalis, area hypothalamica intermedia, area hypothalamica lateralis and area hypothalamica posterior) or into three longitudinal zones (periventricular zone, medial zone, and lateral zone). The hypothalamic nuclei constitute that part of the corticodiencephalic mechanism that activates, controls and integrates the peripheral autonomic mechanisms, endocrine activity, and many somatic functions, e.g., a general regulation of water balance, body temperature, sleep, and food intake, and the development of secondary sex characteristics. The hypothalamus secretes vasopressin and oxytocin, which are stored in the pituitary, as well as many releasing factors (hypophysiotropic hormones), by means of which it exerts control over functions of the adenohypophysis."

def: "Various chemolithotrophs have been found to live in symbiotic association with animals of the thermal vents. E.g., the 2-m-long tube worms lack a mouth, gut or anus but contain a modified gastrointestinal tract consisting of spongy tissue called the trophosome.  Making up about 50% of the weight of the worm, trophosome tissue is loaded with sulfur granules and large numbers of symbiotic prokaryotic cells (ave. of 4 X 109 cells per g of trophosome tissue.)  Trophosome tissue also shows activity of the enzyme RubisCO and other enzymes of the Calvin cycle, the pathway by which most autotrophic organisms fix CO2 into cellular material."

Asynchronous muscle is so-named because during oscillation there is no direct correspondence between individual muscle contractions and muscle action potentials, which contrasts with synchronous muscle in which there is a 1:1 correspondence between muscle contractions and muscle action potentials or bursts of action potentials. Asynchronous muscle is only known to occur in insects. The muscles that power flight in dipteran flies, beetles, many of the true bugs and in some, but perhaps not all, bees and wasps are asynchronous muscles, as are the singing muscles of some cicadas."

Enclosed entirely within the tegument cytoplasm of the tubercle are a series of spines, made of actin, which assist in gripping the blood vessel. The tegument is normally closely apposed to the underlying circular muscle layer, and separated from it only by an extracellular matrix of collagen fibres. The tubercle is the exception, where the tegument is lifted up by numerous extensions of parenchymal cells. The parenchymal cell bodies lie below the muscle layers and send out narrow extensions of cytoplasm which insinuate between the muscles to form the packing for the tubercle." [University of York:R.A.

In this way they bring about and integration between the nervous system and the endocrine system, a process known as neuroendocrine integration. An example of a neuroendocrine cell is the cell of the adrenal medulla (innermost part of the adrenal gland) which releases adrenalin to the blood. The adrenal medullary cells are controlled by the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system. These cells are modified postganglionic neurons. Autonomic nerve fibers lead directly to them from the central nervous system. The major center of neuroendocrine integration in the body is found in the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. Here hypothalamic neurosecretory cells release factors to the blood. Some of these these factors, release at the median eminence, control the secretion of pituitary hormones, while others (the hormones oxytocin and vasopressin) are released directly to the peripheral circulation."

Another location of brain stem cells occurs in the hippocampus, a special structure of the cerebral cortex related to memory function. Stem cells isolated from these areas are able to divide and to give rise to nerve cells and neuron-supporting cell types in culture."

The name comes from the fact that polypeptide production is linked to the uptake of a precursor amino acid and its breakdown in the cell to produce an amine. Examples of the peptide hormones are insulin, corticotropin, glucagon, and antidiuretic hormone. Examples of the amine hormones are dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and histamine."
