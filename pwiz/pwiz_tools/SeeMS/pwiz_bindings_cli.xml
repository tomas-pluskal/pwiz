 \brief Keyword and test function for the indeterminate tribool value

 The \c indeterminate function has a dual role. It's first role is
 as a unary function that tells whether the tribool value is in the
 "indeterminate" state. It's second role is as a keyword
 representing the indeterminate (just like "true" and "false"
 represent the true and false states). If you do not like the name
 "indeterminate", and would prefer to use a different name, see the
 macro \c BOOST_TRIBOOL_THIRD_STATE.
