 The \c indeterminate function has a dual role. It's first role is
 as a unary function that tells whether the tribool value is in the
 "indeterminate" state. It's second role is as a keyword
 representing the indeterminate (just like "true" and "false"
 represent the true and false states). If you do not like the name
 "indeterminate", and would prefer to use a different name, see the
 macro \c BOOST_TRIBOOL_THIRD_STATE.

At each point in the data set a low-degree polynomial is fit to a subset of the data, with explanatory variable values near the point whose response is being estimated. The polynomial is fit using weighted least squares, giving more weight to points near the point whose response is being estimated and less weight to points further away. The value of the regression function for the point is then obtained by evaluating the local polynomial using the explanatory variable values for that data point. The LOESS fit is complete after regression function values have been computed for each of the n data points. Many of the details of this method, such as the degree of the polynomial model and the weights, are flexible.</summary>

neural stem cell: Neural stem cells are the multipotent stem cells that generate nerve cells. However, since the early 1990s, neural stem cells have been isolated from the adult brain as well as fetal brain tissues. Stem cells in the adult brain are found in the areas called the subventricular zone and the ventricle zone. Another location of brain stem cells occurs in the hippocampus, a special structure of the cerebral cortex related to memory function. Stem cells isolated from these areas are able to divide and to give rise to nerve cells and neuron-supporting cell types in culture.

</member>
        <member name="F:BTO_neuroendocrine_cell">
neuroendocrine cell: Neuroendocrine cells are cells that receive neuronal input (neurotransmitters released by nerve cells) and, as a consequence of this input, release message molecules (hormones) to the blood. In this way they bring about and integration between the nervous system and the endocrine system, a process known as neuroendocrine integration. An example of a neuroendocrine cell is the cell of the adrenal medulla (innermost part of the adrenal gland) which releases adrenalin to the blood. The adrenal medullary cells are controlled by the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system. These cells are modified postganglionic neurons. Autonomic nerve fibers lead directly to them from the central nervous system. The major center of neuroendocrine integration in the body is found in the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. Here hypothalamic neurosecretory cells release factors to the blood. Some of these these factors, release at the median eminence, control the secretion of pituitary hormones, while others (the hormones oxytocin and vasopressin) are released directly to the peripheral circulation.

autonomic nervous system: The enteric, parasympathetic, and sympathetic nervous systems taken together. Generally speaking, the autonomic nervous system regulates the internal environment during both peaceful activity and physical or emotional stress. Autonomic activity is controlled and integrated by the central nervous system, especially the hypothalamus and the solitary nucleus, which receive information relayed from VISCERAL AFFERENTS; these and related central and sensory structures are sometimes (but not here) considered to be part of the autonomic nervous system itself.

Thus the circuitry can autonomously sense the tension and the chemical environment in the gut and regulate blood vessel tone, motility, secretions, and fluid transport. The system is itself governed by the central nervous system and receives both parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation.

They have nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. These cells are used in research because of their resemblance to nerve-muscle junctions. Location: In the electric ray Torpedo, electroplax are found near the pectoral muscles and the gills. In all other fishes, it is often near the tail.

tubercle: The adult male dorsal surface of Schistosoma is covered in small bosses called tubercles that provide purchase against the blood vessel wall when the worm is crawling up the mesenteric veins carrying the female in its ventral groove.  Each tubercle has a thin (2-3 micron) covering of the syncytial tegument.  Enclosed entirely within the tegument cytoplasm of the tubercle are a series of spines, made of actin, which assist in gripping the blood vessel. The tegument is normally closely apposed to the underlying circular muscle layer, and separated from it only by an extracellular matrix of collagen fibres. The tubercle is the exception, where the tegument is lifted up by numerous extensions of parenchymal cells. The parenchymal cell bodies lie below the muscle layers and send out narrow extensions of cytoplasm which insinuate between the muscles to form the packing for the tubercle.

Asynchronous muscle is so-named because during oscillation there is no direct correspondence between individual muscle contractions and muscle action potentials, which contrasts with synchronous muscle in which there is a 1:1 correspondence between muscle contractions and muscle action potentials or bursts of action potentials. Asynchronous muscle is only known to occur in insects. The muscles that power flight in dipteran flies, beetles, many of the true bugs and in some, but perhaps not all, bees and wasps are asynchronous muscles, as are the singing muscles of some cicadas.

hypothalamus: A basal part of the diencephalon that lies beneath the thalamus on each side, forms the floor of the third ventricle, and includes vital autonomic regulatory centers.\nThe ventral part of the diencephalon that forms the floor and part of the lateral wall of the third ventricle. Anatomically, it includes the preoptic area, optic tract, optic chiasm, mammillary bodies, tuber cinereum, infundibulum, and neurohypophysis, but for physiological purposes the neurohypophysis is considered a distinct structure. The hypothalamus may be divided into five regions or areas (area hypothalamica rostralis, area hypothalamica dorsalis, area hypothalamica intermedia, area hypothalamica lateralis and area hypothalamica posterior) or into three longitudinal zones (periventricular zone, medial zone, and lateral zone). The hypothalamic nuclei constitute that part of the corticodiencephalic mechanism that activates, controls and integrates the peripheral autonomic mechanisms, endocrine activity, and many somatic functions, e.g., a general regulation of water balance, body temperature, sleep, and food intake, and the development of secondary sex characteristics. The hypothalamus secretes vasopressin and oxytocin, which are stored in the pituitary, as well as many releasing factors (hypophysiotropic hormones), by means of which it exerts control over functions of the adenohypophysis.

LOWESS smoothing: Reduces intensity spikes by applying a modeling method known as locally weighted polynomial regression. At each point in the data set a low-degree polynomial is fit to a subset of the data, with explanatory variable values near the point whose response is being estimated. The polynomial is fit using weighted least squares, giving more weight to points near the point whose response is being estimated and less weight to points further away. The value of the regression function for the point is then obtained by evaluating the local polynomial using the explanatory variable values for that data point. The LOESS fit is complete after regression function values have been computed for each of the n data points. Many of the details of this method, such as the degree of the polynomial model and the weights, are flexible.

mass analyzed ion kinetic energy spectrometry: Spectra that are obtained from a sector mass spectrometer that incorporates at least one magnetic sector plus one electric sector in reverse geometry. The accelerating voltage, V, and the magnetic sector field, B, are set at fixed values to select the precursor ions, which are then allowed to dissociate or to react in a field free region between the two sectors. The kinetic energy product ions of m/z selected precursor ions is analyzed by scanning the electric sector field, E. The width of the product ion spectrum peaks is related to the kinetic energy release distribution (KERD) for the dissociation process.
